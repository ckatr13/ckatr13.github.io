                                            ever-evolving Akron Sound.  Take seasoned, pedigreed musicians playing recognizable 
                                            rock ‘n’ roll/folk/soul melodies and riffs, and deconstruct/reassemble them in the 
                                            style of the great Free Jazz improviser, Albert Ayler.  We’re a “noise” band, but 
                                            where so many in this genre strive to sonically express pain and anger, our approach 
                                            is one of delight and fun.  We are Chris Butler (guitar), Bob Ethington (percussion), 
                                            Corey Jenkins (bass), Michael Aylward (guitar), Jacob Trombetta (pedal steel), Matt Reese 
                                            (cello) and Christina Cruder (reeds).  We play the classics…but like you’ve never heard 
                                            them before.</p>

                                        <p id="desc">This celebrated Charles Jones adaptation of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol is rich 
                                            with thrilling ensemble music, alive with color and movement and is created to tell this great 
                                            and enduring tale in a manner that people of all ages will enjoy. Woven throughout this classic 
                                            tale are beautiful new arrangements and moving renditions of holiday songs such as God Rest Ye 
                                            Merry Gentlemen, Wassail Wassail, Good Christian Men Rejoice, Away in a Manger, Greensleeves, 
                                            the Boar’s Head Carol and many more. Featuring a cast of 24 performers, live musicians, and 
                                            Broadway-style scenery and costumes, audiences cherish this sumptuous holiday classic. In this 
                                            adaptation for the stage, one actor plays Ebenezer Scrooge. Each of the 23 member ensemble supports 
                                            both the story and the music with exceptional ensemble singing and dancing, while each taking on a 
                                            significant character as the story unfolds. The current directors and designers of this production 
                                            do not attempt to stray from Charles Jones’ original conceit. As stewards of the production they 
                                            strive to convey to each company of players the integrity and the magic that are intrinsic to the piece.</p>

                                            and enduring tale in a manner that people of all ages will enjoy. Woven throughout this classic 
                                            tale are beautiful new arrangements and moving renditions of holiday songs such as God Rest Ye 
                                            Merry Gentlemen, Wassail Wassail, Good Christian Men Rejoice, Away in a Manger, Greensleeves, 
                                            the Boar’s Head Carol and many more. Featuring a cast of 24 performers, live musicians, and 
                                            Broadway-style scenery and costumes, audiences cherish this sumptuous holiday classic. In this 
                                            adaptation for the stage, one actor plays Ebenezer Scrooge. Each of the 23 member ensemble supports 
                                            both the story and the music with exceptional ensemble singing and dancing, while each taking on a 
                                            significant character as the story unfolds. The current directors and designers of this production 
                                            do not attempt to stray from Charles Jones’ original conceit. As stewards of the production they 
                                            strive to convey to each company of players the integrity and the magic that are intrinsic to the piece.</p>

                                            significant character as the story unfolds. The current directors and designers of this production 
                                            do not attempt to stray from Charles Jones’ original conceit. As stewards of the production they 
                                            strive to convey to each company of players the integrity and the magic that are intrinsic to the piece.</p>

                                            Based on the cult classic, 1990 John Waters film, Cry-Baby features a delightfully 
                                            demented book from the writers of Hairspray and a rockabilly score from the co-founder

                                            Everyone likes Ike, nobody likes communism and Wade "Cry-Baby" Walker is the coolest 
                                            boy in Baltimore. He's a bad boy with a good cause – truth, justice and the pursuit of 
                                            rock and roll. Cry-Baby and the square rich girl, Allison, are star-crossed lovers at the 
                                            center of this world. Fueled by hormones and the new rhythms of rock and roll, she turns her 
                                            back on her squeaky clean boyfriend, Baldwin, to become a "drape" (a Baltimore juvenile 
                                            delinquent) and Cry-Baby's moll. At the other end of the topsy-turvy moral meritocracy of 
                                            1954 America, Baldwin is the king of the squares and leads his close-harmony pals against 
                                            the juvenile delinquents, who are ultimately arrested for arson, sending the drapes all off 
                                            to prison. It's Romeo and Juliet meets High School Hellcats. Filled with unforgettable songs 
                                            and a truly unique and fresh story. Cry-Baby, Allison and Baltimore's energetic juvenile

                                                Based on the cult classic, 1990 John Waters film, Cry-Baby features a delightfully 
                                                demented book from the writers of Hairspray and a rockabilly score from the co-founder 
                                                of Fountains of Wayne and the executive producer of "The Daily Show." It's 1954. 
                                                Everyone likes Ike, nobody likes communism and Wade "Cry-Baby" Walker is the coolest 
                                                boy in Baltimore. He's a bad boy with a good cause – truth, justice and the pursuit of 
                                                rock and roll. Cry-Baby and the square rich girl, Allison, are star-crossed lovers at the 
                                                center of this world. Fueled by hormones and the new rhythms of rock and roll, she turns her 
                                                back on her squeaky clean boyfriend, Baldwin, to become a "drape" (a Baltimore juvenile 
                                                delinquent) and Cry-Baby's moll. At the other end of the topsy-turvy moral meritocracy of 
                                                1954 America, Baldwin is the king of the squares and leads his close-harmony pals against 
                                                the juvenile delinquents, who are ultimately arrested for arson, sending the drapes all off 
                                                to prison. It's Romeo and Juliet meets High School Hellcats. Filled with unforgettable songs 
                                                and a truly unique and fresh story. Cry-Baby, Allison and Baltimore's energetic juvenile
